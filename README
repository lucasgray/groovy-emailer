groovy-emailer

simple groovy emailer, the groovy way.  javax.mail is seriously old fashioned.  The best features are available in groovy, but java can still have fun.

just fill in the properties file with your info and off you go.

sendEmail >> send email or not.  will just log it if false.
emailOverride >> address ALL emails should be sent to, regardless of their to field.  Useful for testing!
emailServ >> Where your email server is.
defaultFrom >> if you don't provide a from field, this is it.  Something like no-reply@yourco.com probably.

//send one email, with one attachment
def email = new Email(to:["email@email.com"],subject:"email",message:"email",from:"email@email.com")
def attachment = new Attachment(filename: "thePdf.pdf",data: aPdfByteArray, mimetype: 'application/pdf')

email.attachments << attachment
email.send()

//send many emails, in a list, in parallel
def emails = [email1,email2,email3]
emails.send() //using ExpandoMetaClass on java.util.list
