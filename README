groovy-emailer.

simple groovy emailer, the groovy way.

javax.mail is seriously old fashioned.

the best features are available in groovy, but java can still have fun.

//send one email, with one attachment
def email = new Email(to:["email@email.com"],subject:"email",message:"email",from:"email@email.com")
def attachment = new Attachment(filename: "thePdf.pdf",data: aPdfByteArray, mimetype: 'application/pdf')

email.attachments << attachment
email.send()

//send many emails, in a list, in parallel
def emails = [email1,email2,email3]
emails.send() //using ExpandoMetaClass on java.util.list
