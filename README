groovy-emailer [old]

A simple thought experiment I had a few years ago when playing with metaclass in groovy.  The main feature was exploiting the dynamic typing of the language - 
I added a method to List that could operate on a list of emails to send them.  Code examples below.

The best features are available in groovy, but java will work too.

just fill in the properties file with your info and off you go.  Properties file (emailer.properties) must be on classpath to function.

sendEmail >> send email or not.  will just log it if false.
emailOverride >> address ALL emails should be sent to, regardless of their to field.  Useful for testing!
emailServ >> Where your email server is.
defaultFrom >> if you don't provide a from field, this is it.  Something like no-reply@yourco.com probably.

//send one email, with one attachment
def email = new Email(to:["email@email.com"],subject:"email",message:"email",from:"email@email.com")
def attachment = new Attachment(filename: "thePdf.pdf",data: aPdfByteArray, mimetype: 'application/pdf')

email.attachments << attachment
email.send()

//send many emails, in a list, in parallel
def emails = [email1,email2,email3]
emails.send() //using ExpandoMetaClass on java.util.list
